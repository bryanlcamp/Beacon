                            Both your strategy and the Matching Engine receive quotes instantly.<br>
                            No network team required—everything stays on your machine.

                            Your strategy interacts with the Matching engine by submit, update and cancel order operations.<br>
                            You will receive an immediate ack or reject and your strategy can act accordingly.<br>
                            The Matching Engine notifies you immediately when you're filled, an unsolicited cancel or trading halt.

                            Sometimes you want your strategy to compete for liquidity. Not always take it all.<br>
                            The Automatcher addresses this by matching orders based on their time spent in the queue.<br>
                            Your strategy is notified of these matches via trade messages in the quote stream.

                            The Matching Engine has multiple extension points; so you can adapt it as your needs change.<br>
                            Run competing strategies simultaneously. Desired market-making behavior, or order types.<br>
                            Built with flexible architecture, enhancements feel natural, not forced.
