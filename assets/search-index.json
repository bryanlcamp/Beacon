Competition Option 1: Automatch. → If your strategy has no competition, then execution is futile. → Beacon't Matching Engine offers a configurable Automatch. → The Matching Engine listens to your quote stream. → Automatch processes quotes faster as it runs inside the Matching engine. → It can be configured to be as aggressive as you'd ilke. → Note that you can run a handful of Automatchers per product. Competition Option 2: Multiple Strategies. → Beacon supports running multiple strategies at once. → You can run multiple strategies simultaneously. → This method can prove to be even more accurate. → Especially if you're running the same strategy with different settings. Matching Enfgine Functionality. → Whenever the matching receives an order, it is filled or queued. → All message from strategies are sent back into the quote stream, and properly ordered for all to see. → This includes trades, submits, updates, and cancels, → If an Automatch occurs, this is considered a trade. → These messages are sent back to the quote stream and properly ordered as well."

    "content": "Matching Engine - Beacon HFT Platform DEMO MODE Matching Engine. A real-time FIFO matching engine. Driven by your curated dataset. Instant Local Liquidity Liquidity is sourced from your dataset and broadcast locally via UDP. Both your strategy and the Matching Engine receive quotes instantly. No network team required—everything stays on your machine. Strategy Interaction Your strategy interacts with the Matching engine by submit, update and cancel order operations. You will receive an immediate ack or reject and your strategy can act accordingly. The Matching Engine notifies you immediately when you're filled, an unsolicited cancel or trading halt. Automatch Sometimes you want your strategy to compete for liquidity. Not always take it all. The Automatcher addresses this by matching orders based on their time spent in the queue. Your strategy is notified of these matches via trade messages in the quote stream. Scalability The Matching Engine has multiple extension points; so you can adapt it as your needs change. Run competing strategies simultaneously. Desired market-making behavior, or order types. Built with flexible architecture, enhancements feel natural, not forced."

Instant Local Liquidity Liquidity is sourced from your dataset and broadcast locally via UDP. Both your strategy and the Matching Engine receive quotes instantly. No network team required—everything stays on your machine. Strategy Interaction Your strategy interacts with the Matching engine by submit, update and cancel order operations. You will receive an immediate ack or reject and your strategy can act accordingly. The Matching Engine notifies you immediately when you're filled, an unsolicited cancel or trading halt. Automatch Sometimes you want your strategy to compete for liquidity. Not always take it all. The Automatcher addresses this by matching orders based on their time spent in the queue. Your strategy is notified of these matches via trade messages in the quote stream. Scalability The Matching Engine has multiple extension points; so you can adapt it as your needs change. Run competing strategies simultaneously. Desired market-making behavior, or order types. Built with flexible architecture, enhancements feel natural, not forced."
